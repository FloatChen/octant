OCTANT is a toolkit for working with ocean models on a C-Grid

Octant (Ocean C-grid model seTup and Analysis Toolkit) is based on the
python/numpy/matplotlib scientific python suite. NetCDF I/O is based on the
NetCDF4-python package. The toolkit contains general modeling tools for dealing
with arrays, diagnosing standard properties, curvilinear grid generation, and
interpolation. Specific tools are also included for ROMS and GETM.
